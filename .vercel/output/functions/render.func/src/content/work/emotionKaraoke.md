## About the project

**Leading and developing of karaoke web application that detects emotions using TensorFlow.js and Keras Model Library.**

**This project involves the development of a karaoke app that incorporates emotion recognition technology, allowing users to receive scores based on their emotional expression while singing.**

**The app also enables users to share their performances on social media platforms, adding a fun and interactive element to the karaoke experience.**

- Emotion Recognition: Implement emotion recognition algorithms to analyze users' facial expressions and voice intonation while singing. The app can detect emotions such as joy, sadness, excitement, and more.
- Scoring System: Develop a scoring system that evaluates users' emotional expression and synchronicity with the song. Assign points based on factors such as facial expressions, vocal intensity, pitch accuracy, and overall performance.
- Social Media Sharing: Integrate social media sharing functionality that allows users to share their karaoke performances on platforms. Users can showcase their scores, engage with their friends and followers, and prizes from the companies.

### Accomplishments

- Project was large in scale, with one of the biggest Japanese agencies such as Digital Dentsu Inc, and **Dentsu Inc,** involved. My team and I were able to act with precision, delicacy and speed to coordinate a successful launch.
- Knowledge in machine learning, including TensorFlow.js and KerasModel
- Familiarity with SSG (Static Site Generation), ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration), CSR (Client-Side Rendering), and SSR (Server-Side Rendering) in Next.js
