## About the project

**This project involves developing a web and native application for controlling and monitoring remote operation robots using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2).**

**The application will provide an intuitive user interface for users to remotely control the robots and monitor their actions in real-time.**

**The robot is equipped with a camera, and the user can control the robot's movement and create map, and can be control created maps.**

- Interactive Mapping: Incorporate mapping functionality to provide a visual representation of the robot's environment. Allow users to navigate the robot using the map, set waypoints, and track the robot's position in real-time.
- Data Logging and Analysis: Implement a data logging system to record robot actions, user inputs, and sensor data. Provide analysis tools and visualizations to review and analyze recorded data for performance evaluation and optimization.
- Security and Authentication: Implement appropriate security measures, such as IP address authentication, to ensure the privacy and integrity of the remote operation system.
- User Interface: Design an intuitive user interface that allows users to easily control the robot and monitor its actions in real-time.
- Cross-platform Compatibility: Develop the application to be compatible with both web and Windows platforms, ensuring accessibility across various devices and operating systems.
